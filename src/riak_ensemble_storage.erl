%% This module implements a central storage manager for riak_ensemble.
%% Previously, individual ensembles as well as the ensemble manager would
%% independently save their own state to disk. However, such an approach
%% scaled poorly as the number of independent ensembles increased. It was
%% not uncommon to see thousands of synchronous writes issued to disk per
%% second, overwhelming the I/O subsystem. To solve this issue, this storage
%% manager was created.
%%
%% Rather than storing data independently, the storage manager combines the
%% state from multiple ensembles as well as the ensemble manager into a
%% single entity that is stored together in a single file. Since this file
%% is now a critical single point of failure, the storage manager uses the
%% new {@link riak_ensemble_save} logic to save this data to disk such that
%% there are four redundant copies to recover from.
%%
%% This manager is also responsible for coalescing multiple writes together
%% to reduce disk traffic. Individual writes are staged in an ETS table and
%% then flushed to disk after a delay (eg. 50ms).
%%
%% There are two ways to save data to disk that are used by other components
%% in riak_ensemble: synchronous and asynchronous.
%%
%% For synchronous writes components use the sequence:
%%   riak_ensemble_storage:put(Key, Data),
%%   riak_ensemble_storage:sync().
%% The sync() call than blocks until the data has successfully been written,
%% to disk.
%%
%% For asynchronous writes, components simply use put() without sync(). The
%% data will then be written to disk either when another component calls sync,
%% or after next storage manager tick (eg. every 5 seconds).
