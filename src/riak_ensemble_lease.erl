%% @doc
%% This module is used by {@link riak_ensemble_peer} to keep track of
%% an established leader lease. The leader is responsible for periodically
%% refreshing its lease, otherwise the lease will timeout.
%%
%% Using a time-based lease in a distributed system is not without issue.
%% This module does its best to address these concerns as follows:
%%
%% 1. This module uses Erlang based timeouts to trigger lease expiration.
%%    Erlang uses time correction to attempt to occur for clock issues,
%%    as discussed here:
%%      http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html
%%
%% 2. In addition to Erlang time, this module also double checks the
%%    lease against the OS monotonic clock. The monotonic clock is
%%    is not affected by the user/NTP changing the system clock, and
%%    is designed to always move forward (although, virtualization
%%    somtimes affects this guarantee).
%%
%% Likewise, riak_ensemble is designed such that the lease and leader refresh
%% are much smaller than the follower timeout. All of these factors, along
%% with riak_ensemble being designed to maintain strong leadership (unlike
%% other systems such as Raft) make the use of leader leases safe in pratice.
%% As a reminder, Google is also known to use leader leases it its paxos
%% implementation as discussed in their "Paxos Made Live" paper.
%%
%% Of course, users that do not trust leader leases can always set the
%% trust_lease application variable to false, causing riak_ensemble to ignore
%% leader leases and always perform full quorum operations.
